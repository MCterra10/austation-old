<h1>Welcome to AuStation 13!</h1>

<h2 style="color:red;">THE SERVER IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION!</h2>
While I don't mind if you join, note that there is probably nobody else online
<br>
Furthermore, please note that there are currently no rules in place
<br>
and as such you are free to plasma flood, delam the sm and essentially do anything else you want.
<br>
In fact, I recommend you do as many lag inducing activities as possible so I can see how the server holds up.
<br>
If you notice excessive lag please contact me at <b style="color:green;">terra@mcterra.id.au</b>
<br><br>
<b style="color:fuchsia;">Because people are actually joining the damn server I have created a Discord.</b>
